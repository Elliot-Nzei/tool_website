### Financial Calculations (Backend Logic Required)

Once bank statements are processed, the following metrics will be calculated:

*   **Recurring Expenses**:
    *   **Definition**: Transactions of similar amounts occurring at regular intervals (e.g., monthly, weekly) to the same payee.
    *   **Calculation**: Identify transactions with consistent amounts and frequencies to the same recipient over a defined period (e.g., 3+ occurrences in 3 months). Examples: rent, subscriptions, loan payments.

*   **Savings**:
    *   **Definition**: The portion of income not spent or consumed. This can be explicit transfers to savings accounts or the difference between total income and total expenses.
    *   **Calculation**: `Total Monthly Income - Total Monthly Expenses`. If the bank statement includes transfers to savings accounts, those can also be explicitly tracked as savings.

*   **Highest Expense**:
    *   **Definition**: The single largest outgoing transaction within the analyzed period.
    *   **Calculation**: Identify the transaction with the maximum absolute value among all expense transactions.

*   **Total Monthly Earned**:
    *   **Definition**: The sum of all income transactions (e.g., salary, freelance payments, interest) within the analyzed month.
    *   **Calculation**: Sum all credit transactions (money coming into the account) for the given month.
